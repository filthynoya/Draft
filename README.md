# Draft

This project aims to create a website for blog posting. Different users can
create an account and start uploading their journey through life as a blog post.
There are multiple catalogs to choose for uploading blog posts so then others
can sort what they want to see or read. Users can also comment on other
people's blogs to engage in communication. Each user will have their own
profile which others can see. In that profile page, userâ€™s all post will be
displayed. Users can also report other people's blogs if they violate TOS or in
the wrong catalog. There are also email verification and reset password
features if the user does forget about the password. There is an admin panel
where admins can observe about the users, post, mail etc. They can add or
remove categories at their will.
